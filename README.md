Goal 2: Data Science
  - Outcome 2.1: Develop fluency in one statistical programming language and gain familiarity with a second language
    + Demonstrated by file 'collatz.m'
    + While most proficient in R, as evident by other attached files, this file shows familiarity with using MATLAB through development of simulations
  - Outcome 2.2: Translate a data analytic problem into a set of computational steps, and show how they work in real data
    + Demonstrated by file 'MATH410_Final Project.Rmd'
    + This project addresses the issue if it possible for an MLB team to not win a World Series for 106 years
    + Computational steps were discussed in how to approach this problem without real data using hypothetical assumptions
    + Then, real data was applied to make the problem more realistic and get a more accurate answer using the computational steps already developed
  - Outcome 2.3: Set up and run a Monte Carlo or simulation study to investigate a problem
    + Demonstrated by file 'Task 7.Rmd'
    + This file contains a simulation that randomly samples through a Markov Chain of a hypothetical gambling game to determine the probability of leaving the gambling establishment broke
  - Outcome 2.4: Import, clean, and appropriately format data from a variety of sources
    + Demonstrated by file 'Final Analytic Project.Rmd'
    + Four tables of data were imported from healthdata.gov 
    + The pipe function was used to select desired columns from each table to create new data frames
    + Columns were left joined to match up replicated columns between the tables
    + Irrelevant values were replaced with NAs
    + A few columns were formatted to be factor variables
