Goal 4: Statistical Practice and Problem Solving
  - Outcome 4.1: Present the findings of a data analytic project, demonstrating writing, speaking, and presentation skills
    + Demonstrated by files 'Final Analytic Project.Rmd' and 'Tennis Racquet Vibrations.Rmd'
    + Presented findings as a class project
    + Fulfilled the Capstone requirement of writing a thesis paper and giving a presentation on research
    + Further, presented “Optimizing NFL Route Combinations” at UP-STAT 2019 at the University of Rochester
  - Outcome 4.2: Plan and collaborate with others on a project designed to answer a disciplinary question using real data
    + Demonstrated by files 'Tennis Racquet Vibrations.Rmd' and 'MATH410_Final Project.Rmd'
    + Collaborated with a professor to develop models that simulated a vibration in a tennis racquet
    + Provided an explanation of whether a 106 year drought of not winning a World Series in reasonable in the MLB; Used real MLB data from 1908 to 2016; Worked with a group of classmates
    + In the project, 'Optimizing NFL Route Combinations,' data was used from the NFL season to optimize receiver route combinations based on the offensive formation, defensive formation, and how many defenders are in the box; This project was worked on with another statistics major
  - Outcome 4.3: Demonstrate competence with using multiple models and methods for addressing a question in real data, and draw appropriate conclusions
    + Demonstrated by files 'Tennis Racquet Vibrations.Rmd' and 'MATH410_Final Project.Rmd'
    + Created a flexible, stiff, and crossed string model to simulate wave vibrations in a tennis racquet to see how their vibrations differ; tested three methods (data table/matrix/vector) and compared them using benchmark to improve the efficiency of the models for the entirety of the project
    + Refined a model to answer the question of whether a 106-year World Series drought for a MLB team is probable; Compared alpha and beta parameters to retrieve a beta distribution of the winning percentages, simulated using a Markov Chain
