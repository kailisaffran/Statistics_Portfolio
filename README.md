Goal 3: Mathematical Foundations
  - Outcome 3.1: Demonstrate knowledge of integration and differentiation
    + Demonstrated by file 'Tennis Racquet Vibrations.Rmd'
    + Shows differentiation of the wave equation
    + Further knowledge of integration and differentiation was demonstrated in Maple in the courses Calculus III and Dynamical Systems, to solve triple integrals and ordinary differential equations
  - Outcome 3.2: Demonstrate knowledge of linear algebra (emphasis on matrix manipulations, linear transformations, projections in Euclidean space, eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition, and singular value decomposition)
    + Demonstrated by file 'Task 6.Rmd'
    + Shows the ability to find long run behavior using matrix multiplication and eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition
  - Outcome 3.3: Demonstrate knowledge of probability (emphasis on conditional probability and independence, random variables, functions and sums of random variables, moment-generating functions, Markov chains and other probability models, Monte Carlo methods, and applications of conditional probability)
  + Demonstrated by files 'Task 7.Rmd,' 'Task 9.Rmd,' and 'HW 3 Simulations.Rmd'
  + Shows the ability to use Markov Chains, simulate random numbers, and create simulations to find probabilities
  + Additional knowledge in conditional probability, independence, and random variables was obtained in the courses Math Stats and Probability Models
