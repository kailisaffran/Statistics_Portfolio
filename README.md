Goal 5: Discipline-Specific Knowledge
  - Outcome 5.1: Acquire a minor or second major in a discipline that uses quantitative research methods
    + Acquired second major: Mathematics
  - Outcome 5.2: Render a disciplinary research question or problem in statistical and computational terms
    + Demonstrated by files 'Final Analytic Project.Rmd,' 'Dog Vocalizations.Rmd,' and 'MATH410_Final Project.Rmd'
    + Research Question: "Do behavioral factors have a significant effect on a county's overall percentage of cancer deaths?"
    + Research Question: "Are there differences in the acoustic structure of dog vocalizations between different emotions?" 
    + Research Question: "Are the Chicago Cubs really a lousy team or is a 106 year drought of not winning a World Series expected and they just happened to be that team?"
  - Outcome 5.3: Conduct a project that addresses a disciplinary question with real data from that field
    + Demonstrated by files 'Final Analytic Project.Rmd,' 'Dog Vocalizations.Rmd,' and 'MATH410_Final Project.Rmd'
    + Research question addressed using real data from healthdata.gov, titled "Community Health Status Report," and provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    + Research questinon addressed manually collecting data from YouTube
    + Research question addressed using real MLB data between 1908 and 2016
