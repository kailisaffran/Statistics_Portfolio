This reflects my ability to do all of the things required by the learning outcomes in St. John Fisher's Statistics program.

- Goal 1: Statistial Methods and Theory
  + Outcome 1.1: Design a study capable of testing a causal hypothesis and explain how study design is related to evidence for and conclusions about a hypothesis
  + Outcome 1.2: Use graphical methods to summarize univariate and bivariate distributions and develop insights through graphical data summaries
  + Outcome 1.3: Demonstrate competency in fitting and interpreting statistical models for both continuous and categorical outcome variables
  + Outcome 1.4: Use resampling methods for statistical inference, including parameter estimation and hypothesis testing
 
 - Goal 2: Data Science
 + Outcome 2.1: Develop fluency in one statistical programming language and gain familiarity with a second language
 + Outcome 2.2: Translate a data analytic problem into a set of computational steps, and show how they work in real data
 + Outcome 2.3: Set up and run a Monte Carlo or simulation study to investigate a problem
 + Outcome 2.4: Import, clean, and appropriately format data from a variety of sources
 
 - Goal 3: Mathematical Foundations
 + Outcome 3.1: Demonstrate knowledge of integration and differentiation.
 + Outcome 3.2: Demonstrate knowledge of linear algebra (emphasis on matrix manipulations, linear transformations, projections in Euclidean space, eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition, and singular value decomposition)
 + Outcome 3.3: Demonstrate knowledge of probability (emphasis on conditional probability and independence, random variables, functions and sums of random variables, moment-generating functions, Markov chains and other probability models, Monte Carlo methods, and applications of conditional probability)
 
 - Goal 4: Statistical Practice and Problem Solving
 + Outcome 4.1: Present the findings of a data analytic project, demonstrating writing, speaking, and presentation skills
 + Outcome 4.2: Plan and collaborate with others on a project designed to answer a disciplinary question using real data
 + Outcome 4.3: Demonstrate competence with using multiple models and methods for addressing a question in real data, and draw appropriate conclusions
 
 - Goal 5: Discipline-Specific Knowledge
 + Outcome 5.1: Acquire a minor or second major in a discipline that uses quantitative research methods
 + Outcome 5.2: Render a disciplinary research question or problem in statistical and computational terms
 + Outcome 5.3: Conduct a project that addresses a disciplinary question with real data from that field
