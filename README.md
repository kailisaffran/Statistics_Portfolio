Goal 1: Statistial Methods and Theory
  - Outcome 1.1: Design a study capable of testing a causal hypothesis and explain how study design is related to evidence for and conclusions about a hypothesis
    + Demonstrated by 'Project #1.Rmd'
    + Tested the hypothesis of whether listening to dance music improves memory, using data from the Islanders
    + Performed a randomized experimental pre-post test 
    + Used a t-test and permutation test to test hypothesis
    + These tests state how similar the means are between two groups which is suitable for this type of hypothesis
  - Outcome 1.2: Use graphical methods to summarize univariate and bivariate distributions and develop insights through graphical data summaries
    + Demonstrated by 'part 4 data project.Rmd'
    + Gained insight on standard deviation, skewness, and other descriptive statistics of the variables
    + For bivariate analysis, similar distributions and descriptive statistics implies similarity between variables and, therefore, same effect on the response variable
  - Outcome 1.3: Demonstrate competency in fitting and interpreting statistical models for both continuous and categorical outcome variables
    + Demonstrated by 'Interaction.R'
    + Linear models of interaction between variables and how they affect one another
    + Interpretations for continuous and categorical variables are given in the code
  - Outcome 1.4: Use resampling methods for statistical inference, including parameter estimation and hypothesis testing
    + Demonstrated by files 'Model Validation.Rmd,' 'Permutation test.Rmd,' and 'Resampling.Rmd'
    + Shows knowledge of the resampling techniques cross validation, permutation resampling, and bootstrapping
